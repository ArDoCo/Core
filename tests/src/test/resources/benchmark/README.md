# Benchmark
This repository contains a benchmark for traceability link recovery (TLR) between textual Software Architecture Documentation (SAD) and Software Architecture Models (SAM).

Each project of the benchmark is structured as follows:

* The README of each project contains some information about the used languages and lines of code created with [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc).
* The folder `pcm` contains a Palladio Component Model (PCM) of the system. It has at least the repository view (components) of the system.
* The folder `uml` contains a Papyrus UML model. It is created from the PCM Repository using [PCM2UML](https://github.com/InFormALin/PCM2UML).
* The text file(s) in the project folder contains the SAD of the projects as plain text.
* The file `goldstandard.csv` contains the traceability links between SAD and SAM. It links the model elements by id with the sentences by their number (index starting at 1).

## Using the benchmark
In order to provide an easy approach to use the benchmark, we provide an example TLR approach called [Simple Tracelink Discovery (STD)](https://github.com/ArDoCo/SimpleTracelinkDiscovery/) that uses this benchmark in its [evaluation](https://github.com/ArDoCo/SimpleTracelinkDiscovery/tree/main/src/test/java/io/github/ardoco/simpletracelinkdiscovery/eval).
Therefore, the benchmark is linked to the STD repository via a [git subtree](https://github.com/ArDoCo/SimpleTracelinkDiscovery/tree/main/src/test/resources/benchmark).
